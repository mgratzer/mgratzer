### 👋 Hi there, I'm Martin Gratzer

I started my career as a web developer in a big international [EMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_manufacturing_services) company. Later, I quit my job to focus on my computer sciences 🤓 and business administration 👔 degrees and became a freelancer in 2004. 

In 2008 my focus switched to mobile software product development 📱, leading to my company [topmind GmbH](https://topmind.eu). 

Since then, I have enjoyed working in leading technical and product/project/team management roles of awarded mobile apps and SDKs like [MindMeister](https://apps.apple.com/app/id381073026), [iTranslate](https://apps.apple.com/app/id288113403), [iTranslate Converse](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1241264761), [iTranslate Lingo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1436833817), [Skiline](https://apps.apple.com/app/id406479148), [femSense](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1373747509), [Jungfrau Region](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1465310312), [myZillertal](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1488510082), [bitmovin Player](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-samples) and more.

➡ **Fast forward to 2021**: With 17 years of experience in freelancing and leading software projects, I switched from mobile agency business to product development.
