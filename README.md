### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Martin, and I know things about mobile apps.

After high school in Carinthia, my professional career started as a web developer in a big international [EMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_manufacturing_services) company. I soon switched gears to approach degrees in computer sciences ðŸ¤“ and business administration ðŸ‘”. I also became a freelancer during my time at university. 

With the release of the iPhone, my focus switched to mobile software development ðŸ“±, followed by founding [topmind GmbH](https://topmind.eu) with a passionate team of software engineers. 

Since then, I have enjoyed working in different roles of awarded mobile apps and SDKs like [MindMeister](https://apps.apple.com/app/id381073026), [MeisterTask](https://apps.apple.com/app/id918099883), [iTranslate](https://apps.apple.com/app/id288113403), [iTranslate Converse](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1241264761), [iTranslate Lingo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1436833817), [Skiline](https://apps.apple.com/app/id406479148), [femSense](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1373747509), [Jungfrau Region](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1465310312), [myZillertal](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1488510082), [bitmovin Player](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-samples), [Authenticator App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/authenticator-app/id1610508128), [Over! Walkie-Talkie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/over-walkie-talkie/id1632587029) and more.

Since 2022, I have been a Senior Staff Engineer in charge of all iOS functions at [Meister](https://www.meisterlabs.com).
