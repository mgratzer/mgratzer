### 👋 Hi there, I'm Martin Gratzer

I started my career as a web developer in a big international [EMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_manufacturing_services) company. I quit my job to focus on my degrees in computer sciences 🤓 and business administration 👔 and became a freelancer in 2004. 

In 2008 I switched my focus to mobile software product development 📱, which later leads to my company [topmind GmbH](https://topmind.eu). 

Since then, I had the pleasure to have leading roles in the initial and ongoing development of awarded iOS apps and SDKs like [MindMeister](https://apps.apple.com/app/id381073026), [iTranslate](https://apps.apple.com/app/id288113403), [iTranslate Converse](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1241264761), [iTranslate Lingo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1436833817), [Skiline](https://apps.apple.com/app/id406479148), [femSense](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1373747509), [Jungfrau Region](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1465310312), [myZillertal](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1488510082), [bitmovin Player](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-samples) and more.

➡ Fast forward to 2021: With 17 years of experience in freelancing and leading a software company, I switched from mobile agency business - selling my team's time for money - to product development. Wish me luck!
